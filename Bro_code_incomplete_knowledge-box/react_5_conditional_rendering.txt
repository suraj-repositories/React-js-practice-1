Condititional rendering : 
    if defines to load the components based on the conditions
        => by using ternery operator
        => by using if else conditions
    
    one thing what i learn in this video : we can store the html to the variable directly in react

    example: 
        let myFooter = <footer> &copy; copyright 2024 all rights reserved! </footer>
